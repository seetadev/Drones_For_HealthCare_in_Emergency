# Drones For Cost Effective HealthCare Delivery in Emergency Hit Areas
Detecting and monitoring UAVs &amp; Drone traffic to enhance their management and ensure security, privacy and safety of citizens using object detection, decentralized data storage and predictive analysis for enabling the bottom of the pyramid through EHR and radiology services on the IBM cloud in crisis hit areas and emergency situations.

Innovation: A greater and more seamless flow of information within a digital health care infrastructure, created by electronic health records (EHRs), encompasses and leverages digital progress and can transform the way care is delivered and compensated especially in crisis hit areas and emergency affected regions around the world.
1. EHRs helps in care coordination.
2. EHRs helps in making health care ecosystem proactive, accessible and authentic in emergency hit areas.
3. EHRs with the help of computer aided detection will help in early prediction and diagnosis of diseases in crisis situations.
A more safe & regulated local air traffic of drones & UAVs with availability of movement data and prediction of future of conditions in emergency hit areas.

Business Benefits in Crisis Hit areas:
1. Patients
•Make instant appointments with a doctor and get quick access to e-records in emergency hit areas;
•Computer-aided detection will help in early prediction and diagnosis of diseases in crisis situations.

2. Doctors and Hospitals
•Prioritize and handle appointments better in crisis hit areas;
•Issue prescriptions;
•Coordinate with specialists;
•Access to accurate records;
•Improved care.

3. Administrator and Insurers
•Connect all stakeholders;
•Personalize care treatment;
• Accurate and timely payments;
•Reduce the cost of centralized systems.

4. Employees
•Administer Benefit;
•Reduce healthcare costs to employees in emergency affected regions;
•Reward employees;

Notable Features:
1. Medical Transparency : Availability of patient’s medical records affected by crisis across different stakeholder through secure blockchain network. 
2. Data Uniformity : Data is processed to make it uniform and stored in PACS (Picture Archiving Communication System) so that it can be utilized by different stakeholders on verified request. 
3. Data Analytics : With the help of computer aided detection and machine learning algorithms, data can be further used for analysis and early prediction for route patterns and incidents in emergency affected regions.
4. Detection : Identifying the drones & UAVs in the video feed using object detection.
5. Discovery : Logging the identities of the drones & UAVs flying in a particular air space at any instant of time, using exchange of unique identifiers.
6. Geo-fencing : Discovering unlawful presence, raising alarms using the detection & discovery data.
7. Monitoring : Looking out and reporting incidents based on event detection in visual data.
8. Drone Incident Reporting : Publish drone incident reports, preventive measures and remediation using a decentralized twitter application over the Ethereum blockchain network and Embark Tools.

Tools: We engineer, develop technology on ethereum blockchain using NuCypher protocol, SAP UI5 and IBM Cloud, OSS spreadsheet and PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication Systems).
