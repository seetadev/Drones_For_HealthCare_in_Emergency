# Drones, EHR (Electronic Health Records) as a Service and Radiology on the Cloud For Cost Effective HealthCare Delivery in Emergency Hit Areas
Detecting and monitoring UAVs &amp; Drone traffic to enhance their management and ensure security, privacy and safety of citizens using object detection, decentralized data storage and predictive analysis for enabling the bottom of the pyramid through EHR and radiology services on the IBM cloud in crisis hit areas and emergency situations.

Innovation: A greater and more seamless flow of information within a digital health care infrastructure, created by electronic health records (EHRs), encompasses and leverages digital progress and can transform the way care is delivered and compensated especially in crisis hit areas and emergency affected regions around the world.
1. EHRs helps in care coordination.
2. EHRs helps in making health care ecosystem proactive, accessible and authentic in emergency hit areas.
3. EHRs with the help of computer aided detection will help in early prediction and diagnosis of diseases in crisis situations.

Utilization of Drones in Safer and more efficient surveys: Accurate, georefferenced point clouds for measurements, 3d visualization and export.Conduct volume measurements in the point cloud, create contour lines and digitize models for break lines. Use the quality report to access and control data quality.

Notable Features:
1. Medical Transparency : Availability of patient’s medical records affected by crisis across different stakeholder through secure blockchain network. 
2. Data Uniformity : Data is processed to make it uniform and stored in PACS (Picture Archiving Communication System) so that it can be utilized by different stakeholders on verified request. 
3. Data Analytics : With the help of computer aided detection and machine learning algorithms, data can be further used for analysis and early prediction for route patterns and incidents in emergency affected regions.
4. Detection : Identifying the drones & UAVs in the video feed using object detection.
5. Discovery : Logging the identities of the drones & UAVs flying in a particular air space at any instant of time, using exchange of unique identifiers.
6. Geo-fencing : Discovering unlawful presence, raising alarms using the detection & discovery data.
7. Monitoring : Looking out and reporting incidents based on event detection in visual data.
8. Drone Incident Reporting : Publish drone incident reports, preventive measures and remediation using a decentralized twitter application over the Ethereum blockchain network and Embark Tools.

Tools: We engineer, develop technology on ethereum blockchain using NuCypher protocol, SAP UI5 and IBM Cloud, OSS spreadsheet and PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication Systems).
